# SolarSystem
<ul>
  <li>Model of the solar system using Three.js </li>
  <li>Not to scale. </li>
  <li>I'm particularly fond of the subtle effect caused by the earth's clouds' transparent mesh rotating independently of the earth's crust's mesh.</li>
  <li>Plan for the future is to use NASA's API to display information about the planets when clicked.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to run:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>First, make sure you have Node.js installed.</li>
  <li>Download all files and directories into a root directory. For the purposes of this example, we will name said root folder "solar-system".</li>
  <li>Navigate to the solar-system directory in your CLI, then run the "npm install" command to install the node_modules dependencies.</li>
  <li>Once the modules have been installed, run the app using the "node app.js" command.</li>
  <li>If your CLI prints "SERVING", the app is running as expected. On your browser, visit:  <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>.</li>
  <li>You should now see the animated solar system model in your browser.</li>
  <li>You can control the camera by rotating with LMB, panning with RMB, and zooming in and out with MMB. You can also click on the graph on the top left corner to monitor           different performance stats.</li>
  <li>When done, use CTRL+C on the CLI to stop the server.</li>
 </ol>
